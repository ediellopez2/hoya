This project is no longer in use. The website that I was web scraping was taken down and is no longer accessible. I am keeping this project up because it worked really well and shows how I did web scraping, sent emails, and used Twilio. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  

Original Idea:
The purpose of this project is to scrape the specified URL, determine the availability of each plant (In Stock/Not In Stock), and put it all in an Excel spreadsheet.

Future Iterations:
- send the Excel spreadsheet to the client/user via email. [DONE/COMPLETED - 7/11/2020 - find_my_hoya.py]
- send the results to the client/user via SMS with the help of Twilio. [DONE/COMPLETED - 7/5/2020 - hoya_twilio_sms.py]
- send the client/user an SMS notification when the website is down for a restock [In Progress - Version 1.1]
